5. We follow common normalization for TORRENTING.
6. We dont use emojis or leave un-needed comments.
7. The terminal interface is KISS, nothing extra needed.
8. the database is based on either movies or tv shows, check database.py for more information
9. when troubleshootig check other scripts or .md to understand how they work
